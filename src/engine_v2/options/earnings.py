"""Earnings calendar + the blackout predicate (spec 2026-08-03-earnings-blackout).

The gate's claim: a scheduled earnings print inside a short put's life is a
discontinuity 0.30-delta premium was not priced to compensate for, and the
chop scanner's vol-percentile ranking actively selects for names that have one
coming.

THREE states per ticker, and keeping them apart is the whole point. Both "this
ETF has no earnings" and "the lookup for this name failed" present as an empty
calendar; collapsing them is how a gate silently stops existing (the
zombie_check failure class, audit 2026-07-29). The mapping encodes them:

    dates(tk) -> [d1, d2, ...]   known, has prints
    dates(tk) -> []              known, has none (fund, or genuinely none)
    dates(tk) -> None            UNKNOWN -- the gate is blind to this name

Unknown does not block: "unknown state always allows" is the standing
convention from the phase-1/2 regime work. It must therefore be COUNTED by
callers, never shrugged at.
