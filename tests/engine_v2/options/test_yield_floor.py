"""Collateral-yield floor: refuse a short put that pays a negligible fraction
of the cash it locks up.

The pre-existing minimum credit (`fills.tp_exit_floor`) is ABSOLUTE -- $0.025,
i.e. $2.50 per contract at the live config -- and knows nothing about the
strike. A $1,000-strike put locking $100,000 of collateral clears it on a $2.50
credit. The live bot has already done a version of this: a put sold for a $0.01
bid against a $0.77 mid, locking 50% of a $5k account for 14 days (audit
2026-07-29, finding 10).

The floor here is a JUNK filter, not a tuning knob. Measured on 25 tickers /
~39.5k ticker-days / DTE 8-15 over 2024-01 -> 2026-07, the median annualised
yield on collateral is 18.3% at 0.20 delta, 30.9% at 0.30 and 45.6% at 0.40;
the least generous legitimate name measured is XLU at 8.4%. A 0.08 floor
therefore sits just under everything a human would knowingly trade while
killing the owner's $10-on-$100k case by two orders of magnitude.
