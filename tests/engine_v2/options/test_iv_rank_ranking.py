"""IV rank as the SORT KEY, not a veto.

Why this exists: the veto was measured on the real portfolio (2026-08-04,
scratchpad/run_iv_rank_ab.py) and REJECTED. It raises P&L per campaign ~14%
and halves campaign count 254 -> 130, costing 18 points of total return:

    arm                 total    Sharpe   campaigns   P&L/campaign
    baseline (off)     +43.0%      1.10         254           $169
    iv_rank >= 0.88    +24.9%      0.84         130           $192
    iv_rank >= 0.90    +21.4%      0.77         121           $177
    iv_rank >= 0.95     +9.5%      0.39          80           $119

The signal is real; the instrument was wrong. A veto trades quality for
volume, and the wheel's return comes from capital turnover -- a refused entry
leaves the slot earning nothing that week.

So: rank, don't filter. The engine currently sorts candidates by
`vol_pctile` (REALIZED vol, highest first) -- it picks maximum risk with no
check on the price paid for taking it, and the weather gate has already capped
realized vol at the 75th percentile, so it chooses inside a 70-75th percentile
sliver on the wrong variable. Replacing that key with IV rank changes WHICH 5
names fill the slots without changing HOW MANY get filled, so it never pays
the turnover cost that killed the veto.

Owner decisions, 2026-08-05:
  1. REPLACE, not blend. Pure IV-rank sort is the honest A/B -- one variable,
     no weight to tune, and a losing result is readable.
  2. Unknown ranks sort at NEUTRAL (0.5), not last. Sorting unknowns last
     silently de-prioritises every thin-history name, which is a filter
     wearing a sort's clothes -- exactly the failure mode above.
