"""Our own implied-volatility solver -- the one that owns the SCALE.

Why this exists (owner ruling 2026-08-07, [[2026-08-07 - The IV provenance rule,
the solver is the scale]]): IV rank is a percentile of a ticker against its own
trailing 252 observations, so every observation in a series must be produced the
same way. Vendors do not agree -- but measured over 63,016 ranked ticker-days, two
different IV models fed identical quotes pick the SAME top-ranked name on 95.5% of
days (spearman 0.9988). So vendor identity is cheap and a mid-window MODEL CHANGE is
not: it shifts every post-change observation relative to its own past and pins ranks
toward 0 or 1.

The live bot pulls Schwab daily while the history came from a vendor. That splice is
guaranteed unless WE compute the IV from THEIR quotes. Hence this module: vendors
supply quotes, this supplies IV, and the scale never changes when the source does.

The convention is fitted, not assumed -- 6,240 live Schwab contracts across 42
tickers, 2026-08-06 (scratchpad/diag_schwab_iv_fit.py):

    calendar days / 365       median err -0.0015   <- fitted
    trading days / 252        median err -0.0742   <- decisively wrong
    mark vs mid               indistinguishable
    rate/dividend zeroed      mean abs err 0.0169 -> 0.0189 (barely matters)

Restricted to the OTM 0.20-0.40 delta band the bot actually trades, plain European
Black-Scholes matches Schwab to a median absolute 0.0063, p90 0.0144 -- including
dividend payers (q>=2.5%: 0.0089; q>=4%: 0.0052).

OUTSIDE that band it falls apart: ITM p90 0.1627, and dividend payers ITM 0.0705
median (Ford reads +0.154 ITM vs +0.031 in-band). An American engine and discrete
dated dividends would be needed there. `select_contract` targets a 0.30-delta PUT,
which is OTM essentially always, so the series never records those contracts -- and
that restriction is the whole correctness argument, so it is ENFORCED here rather
than documented. If the observation ever needs to move ITM, this module is void.
