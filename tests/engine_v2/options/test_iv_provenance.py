"""Provenance on the IV series: one scale per ticker, enforced.

Owner ruling 2026-08-07 ([[2026-08-07 - The IV provenance rule, the solver is the
scale]]). IV rank is a percentile of a ticker against its OWN trailing window, so a
bias that is constant within that ticker cancels completely -- measured, two
different IV models on identical quotes pick the same top-ranked name on 95.5% of
63,016 ranked ticker-days (spearman 0.9988).

What does NOT cancel is a scale change INSIDE the window. It shifts every
post-change observation relative to its own past and pins ranks toward 0 or 1, while
every log line still looks healthy. That is the same shape as the zombie gate the
2026-07-29 audits kept finding, and the same shape as `chain_store` serving
yesterday's file as today's.

So the source is a permanent property of a TICKER, not of a batch or a load, and a
source change must REBUILD that ticker's history rather than append to it. This file
pins that as a loud refusal rather than a convention someone has to remember.
